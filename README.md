# Architecture-based Risk Analysis

<img src="images/KeyVisual.jpg" width="250" />

## Motivation
The automotive industry is undergoing a transformation shift with the advent of Software-defined Vehicles (SdV) and central Electronic Control Units (ECUs), introducing unprecedented complexity within product development. In the con-text of agile methodologies, adhering to traditional risk analysis approaches becomes challenging due to the rapid release cycles and continuous evolution of products.

## Approach
Architecture-based Risk Analysis addresses these challenges by adding a minimal extension to UML/SysML. This enables agile workflows on architecture models, and the usage of architecture verification tools as support for the engineers and quality gates.
This enables us to bring architecture models and risk analysis into a pull-request based workflow, and in case of software-systems closer to the code.

## Enabling
The purpose of this repository is to facilitate the adoption of the architecture-based risk analysis by

- providing the meta-model and the thoughts behind.
- providing guidelines and lessons-learned
- providing tooling for a simple adoption by architects
- providing automation-solutions for a simple adopting in projects
